# Simple Blockchain Simulation

A Python implementation of a basic blockchain that demonstrates core blockchain concepts including block structure, hashing, chain validation, and proof-of-work.

## Features

- Block structure with index, timestamp, transactions, previous hash, and current hash
- SHA-256 hashing algorithm
- Blockchain class with methods to:
  - Add new blocks
  - Validate chain integrity
  - Detect tampering
- Simple Proof-of-Work implementation
- Demonstration of tamper detection

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- No additional libraries required (uses standard Python modules)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Nayak251/simple-blockchain-simulation.git
   cd simple-blockchain-simulation

2. No additional installation is required as it uses Python's standard libraries.

## Usage

Run the simulation directly with Python:
python blockchain.py

The program will:

1. Create a new blockchain with a genesis block
2. Add some sample transactions
3. Mine blocks containing those transactions
4. Print the blockchain
5. Validate the chain
6. Demonstrate tamper detection

## Sample Output

You should see output similar to:

=== Initial Blockchain ===
Block 0:
Timestamp: 2023-11-15 14:30:00
Transactions: ['Genesis Transaction']
Previous Hash: 0
Nonce: 0
Hash: 5d16e8...

Mining block 1...
Block mined in 0.45 seconds. Nonce: 5432

=== Blockchain after mining first block ===
Block 0:
[details...]

Block 1:
[details...]

=== Blockchain Validation ===
Blockchain is valid!

=== Tampering with the blockchain ===
Tampered with block 1 by adding a fake transaction!

=== Blockchain Validation After Tampering ===
Block 1 has been tampered with!
Blockchain is invalid!

## Code Structure

- `Block` class: Represents individual blocks in the chain
- `Blockchain` class: Manages the chain of blocks and provides key operations
- Main demonstration: Shows the blockchain in action with mining and validation

## Customization

You can modify these aspects:

- `difficulty` in the Blockchain class to change the proof-of-work requirement
- Add more transactions by calling `add_transaction()` before mining
- Adjust the tampering demonstration in the main block
